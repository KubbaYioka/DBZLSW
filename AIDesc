AI Types and descriptions

AI is simply a subroutine with a set of priorities when making a decision in a turn ingame

AI has several different types. The differences between them is what they will
prioritize in a match. 

For instance, one AI will strike only after gaining a certain amount of CC
for a move, whereas another will strike only after a CC threshhold is met.

Some will favor attacking, some may favor stat boosts, and some may favor 
preserving HP as much as possible.

The first thing an AI will do is gather information. This information will
be in regards to themselves and the player. 

The priorities they have determines what move they will make. This could be
a decision to power-up, use a basic attack in a CC saving method, or using a
card from the deck, among many other things. 

AI types will use different kinds of decision trees based on the information
they collect. 

While they will share many info gathering code, they will have separate decision
code.
