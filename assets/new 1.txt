Long ago...

So long ago that everyone forgot...

7 magical spheres came to Earth.

When gathered, these sacred orbs call forth the Eternal Dragon!

The Dragon will then grant a single wish!

However, everyone has forgotten this legend.[The legend has been forgotten]

Including the boy who owns one of these balls as a keepsake from his late grandfather. [The boy has forgotten-- the boy who owns one of these balls as a keepsake from his late grandfather]

The boy's name is Son Goku.

Despite his size, Goku has remarkable strength and skill, making him exceptional!

Not to mention his tail!

Ever since his grandfather passed away, Goku has lived alone deep in the woods.

But he is more than capable of taking care of himself.

This will come in handy as he is about to set out on an adventure that will change his life!

Goku: Okay! Grandpa, I'm headed out to get some food. I'll be back soon. Don't go anywhere, okay?

Goku sets out to find food like he normally does this time of day. [Goku sets out to find dinner as usual]

He approaches the river down in the lowlands and...

Goku: Aha! The fish are as big as ever!

Goku: Hmmm...I bet I can catch that one!

Fish: Oh please, not me!

Goku: Oh okay...

Big Fish: Small Fry! Get lost before I gobble you up!

Goku: You talkin' to me?

Big Fish: You bet! I'll swallow you whole little boy!

Goku: Ha! A fight? Let's go!

//goto battle

Big Fish: ~~*

Goku: Gotcha!

Goku finds the food he needs, and gathers up his catch.

Goku: Time to get back!

Goku takes the trip back to his grandpa's house...

Meanwhile...

Girl: Wow. I never thought the countryside would be this pretty. It's way different than where I am from.

Girl: To think, the world could be this big and vast. No wonder no one has ever found them all. 

Girl. Ha! But I will!

Who is this mysterious girl?

[[Chapter 1 - The Girl From West City]]

Goku: Broil or sautee'? I'll ask Grandpa what he thinks!

Goku: Huh... what's that?

*Girl's car approaches at high speed*

Goku: Auuaaagh! 

Girl: Aaaaah!

*BAM*

Girl: Oh my god! Oh my god! I hit him!

Goku ...

Girl: Huh? Hey! Are you okay?

Goku: ...Uuugh. Hey! What'd you go and do that for?

Girl: Oh my god...

Goku: Grrrr! You're after my fish aren't you!

Girl: What? Y-your fish?

Goku: You'll pay for that! Yaaah!

Girl: Woah! Stay back!

*The girl fires several shots from her pistol at Goku*

Goku: Yeaowch!

Girl: No way!

Goku: I'll show you!

//goto battle

Girl: Aaah! My car!

Goku: You won't be stealing any fish today! Get your own!

Girl: W-wait! I'm not a monster! I'm a girl!

Goku: Uh...a what?

The girl climbs from the car.
