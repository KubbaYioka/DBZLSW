Currently, BattleController:start and setAttStep in comm.lua are checking the action against the list of potential stage attacks twice. This is redundant and possibly not needed.

---- Battle ----
 In MoveField, make the selection cursor start in the position the player is in.
Insert graphics\animation display between turns. Should design animation engine - in progress
Create in-battle sprites for players
Provide move logic for changing places on the battlefield - Mostly complete
Create logic for limit deck - Almost done
Create logic for power-up, fighting stance.
Command Input
   - input logic for missed command input - mostly done
   - attacker movement logic - Basics nearly done
   - slight knockback logic - in progress
   - change background if knocked in air  

Maybe add a CC cap that gets raised with level ups.

Introduce different knockback levels for parries because of failed stg attacks. So a strong enemy will deliver a more devastating counter

---- Story ----
Create more dialogue

---- General ----
Create more triggers for different things to happen (special cards, stories, etc)
